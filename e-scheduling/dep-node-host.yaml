# ANTI-PATTERN: Pin a workload to a specific worker node.
# The only reasonable use case is if you want to run a 
# workload on a specific worker because of the capabilities
# of that host (ie. GPU).  Even then, you should apply
# labels to those hosts and then deploy the workload with
# a selection label.
